# LottoDeal Backend

LottoDeal is a platform that combines the psychological appeal of lotteries with an e-commerce marketplace. Each seller is matched with hundreds of interested micro-bidders who can buy virtual “lottery tickets” for any item. When the item reaches its goal, it is lotteried off, where each bidder has a chance of winning the item proportional to the amount that they bid. This helps buyers bid on items they desire, but don’t necessarily need to win, at a fraction of the cost, all the while allowing sellers to utilize economies of scale to sell their items as fast as possible.
